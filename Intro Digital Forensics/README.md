At the lab, the process goes as follows:
- Create a forensic copy from the evidence(use a advanced software to avoid modifying the original data).
- Return the digital evidence to the secure container.
- Start processing the copy on your forensic workstation.(use hash value for confirm that a file has not been modified).
- Reporting</br>
